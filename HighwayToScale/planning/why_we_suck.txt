- Nate's students though that the version we showed them was sort of plain, but the graphics are better now.
- He likes the list of objects we have in there now.
- Likes the side-by-side comparison and the animation
- **Our UI is very plain. We should fix that.
- They like the idea of tiling better
- The difference between some objects that causes smaller ones to disappear is still bothersome. We should come up with some solution to this.
- replace 8th grade boy & girl with "8th grade student" ----> kids are immature, when one shows up on top of the other
- we still need to add in the items from Lauren's email, those were from Sarah's student feedback
- Lesson Plan
	- 45 minute chunk, not a full period for what we've got so far in Lauren's plan
	- So it looks like the lesson plan stuff is in order. Lauren will most likely be the only one going.
	- Rotate Chesapeake Bay to be longer up and down
	- Henrico County size is not 13 miles across, our measurement is wrong
		- In fact, we should double-check all of our measurements
	
- We're still struggling with what dimensions to use and how to classify them
	- one option is to use the longest dimension as "length" and still have the others floating out there in their respective categories
	- one option is to have them select an object, then choose which dimension they want to compare on
		-this option is probably the best, and the teachers like it the best, but it means the most work for us
		-and by us I probably mean me
